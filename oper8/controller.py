class Controller(abc.ABC):
    """This class represents a controller for a single kubernetes custom
    resource kind. Its primary functionality is to perform a reconciliation of a
    given CR manifest for an instance of the resource kind against the current
    state of the cluster. To accomplish this, its reconciliation logic is:

    1. Construct a Directed Acyclic Graph of all Components that this kind
        needs to manage.
    2. Execute the Graph in dependency order where each node of the graph first
        renders the manifests for all kubernetes resources managed by the
        Component, then applies them to the cluster.
    3. Execute a secondary Graph with verification logic for each Component,
        terminating verification for downstream nodes if any node is not yet
        verified.

    To do this, the main operations of the class are to construct a DAG of
    Components, then walk them through the primary lifecycle phases:

    1. Run the Component's deploy() function to completion and verify that the
        actual deployment operations succeeded
    2. Run the Component's verify() function to run component-specific tests
        that will verify if the deployment is rolled out in a successful state
