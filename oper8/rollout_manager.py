            1. Deploy Graph: This phase executes the Runner which runs the deploy()
                function for each Component in dependency order. For graph edges
                with configured verification functions, they are also executed
                during this phase.
            2. After Deploy: If configured with an after_deploy hook and (1)
                completed all nodes successfully, this function is called. Any
                raised exceptions indicate that the rollout should not proceed.
            3. Verify Graph: This phase executes the Runner which runs the verify()
                function for each Component in dependency order.
            4. After Verify: If configured with an after_verify hook and (3)
                completed all nodes successfully, this function is called. Any
                raised exceptions indicate that the rollout is not fully
                verified.

        The rollout can terminate in one of three states:
            1. incomplete AND failed: Something unexpected happened and the
                rollout terminated in a fatal state.
            2. incomplete AND NOT failed: One or more nodes did not pass their
                verify steps, but all deploy steps that were attempted
                succeeded.
            3. complete AND NOT failed: The rollout completed all nodes,
                including all verify steps. The managed components are ready to
                take traffic.

        Returns:
            completion_state:  CompletionState
                The final completion state of all nodes in the rollout Runner. This
